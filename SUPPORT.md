# GroupMe @all Support Guidelines

This took a while to get fixed up for use, but as for support- I have an outside reference that's super good with this stuff.
Everything sent to me will be essentially sent to him for help.

If you need support with your project using *@everyone*, you can:

1. Email me with a full description of the issue and any relevant steps you've taken to remedy the problem on your own
2. Or if you have a feeling this is a bug in the code or would like to request a feature, do it yourself, then tell me.
